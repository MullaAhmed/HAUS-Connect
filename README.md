# HAUS-Connect

<p style="text-align:justify";> 
 HAUS-Connect is a platform where faculty of college can schedule or reschedule the meetings or lectures, they also can set reminders for tests and upload study material too. A chatbot will help look for study material. Basically, we want to make sure that none of us miss any deadlines. At the moment this is for college students but its versatility is immense, it can be used on a large scale for communications throughout an enterprise, a single system that manages leaves granted, leave balance, pending work, etc.
